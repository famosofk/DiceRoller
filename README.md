# DiceRoller
Android kotlin Dice Roller app.
I've been programming since I was 15 yo, and I've working daily with android development since 2018 on my own. On april 2020 
I decided to learn Kotlinbecause it's the recommended language for android development since 2017.
That wasn't enough and june 2020 I decided to restart learning android development but this time I'm following Google recommended course.
Because of that I'm publishing several repositories working on it. This is one of those projects. Enjoy!
